title: The return of the duck
---
A few days ago, I described [my dilemma about a duck](/2006/12/24/challenged-by-a-duck.html). It has puzzled me more than a week. I went to the loft every morning, to feed it with rice and water. The first day of 2007, I went to visit it as always, but it disappeared! The rice box was empty, so did the the water pot.

What happened to my poor duck? I looked around the loft, searched every corner of the loft and the roof, till I lost my hope. Had it died? But where was its body? Or It was just Hiding at some place? My poor scared duck!

My mum had gone to my sister. It was this duck accompanying me throughout a whole week. Then I was left alone, at the beginning of new year.

But I always believed that it was alive. I would continue searching it till I found it, alive or dead.

Miracle happened at last. After noon, I was sitting to enjoy H.G. Wells' "The Outline of History", suddenly a though flashed into my mind: the duck! In the loft, I saw it crouched in the corner, its little eyes gazed at me. Oh, my dear!

Mum will arrive this afternoon accompanied by my niece. I hoped mum to come when the duck arrived, but now, I hope her not to come, because her coming means the duck's death.
