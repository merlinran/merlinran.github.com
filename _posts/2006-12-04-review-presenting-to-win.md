title: Review Presenting To Win
---
This is a book praised by so many brilliant people. The main purpose is to teach executives how to plan, prepare, and act their speech, especially company's IPO road show.

I have few opportunities to make a speech. But the content is greatly helpful to me. And I believe this book will offer you equivalent help.

The key points:

+ Know your audience. Prepare your presentation with your audience in mind. Care about their domain, intelligence, and interest on your speech. If you don't, your are preaching to deaf ears.
+ Take your audience from point A to point B. Point A is their current position, and point B is the position you want them to arrive. Focus the whole speech on this main thread.
+ The WIIFY(What's In It For You?) principle. Put yourself in their position, you'll easier persuade them.
+ Don't care about your skill overmuch. If you have sufficient preparation, you'll perform well. I proofed this by my experience.

His wisdom applies not only on normal speech, but also dialy work and life. We commuincate with others everyday and everyplace. We can all benefit from Jerry Weissman's insight.
